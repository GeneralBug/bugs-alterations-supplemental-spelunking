# Bug's Alterations - Supplemental Spelunking
Datapack that makes some minor recipe tweaks to the Fabric versions of [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries) and [Spelunkery](https://modrinth.com/mod/spelunkery), among others. I made these for a mod pack so it's a little all over the place, but something here might be useful to you. Changes include:
 - Rope ladders are now made out of ropes
 - Tangle roots can be used to make ropes
 - Farmers Delight safety nets can now be made from any rope
 - Galosphere pink salt can be used on a grindstone to make salt
 - Dreams and Desires' spectral rubies and Estrogen's balls can be polished on a grindstone
 - Estrogen cookies work in Supplementaries jars
